# [V Rosetta]
> The Collection of V programs written to solve tasks on [Rosetta Code]. 


## Contributing
* [V](github.com/vlang/v) is listed as Vlang. V was taken already.
* A template file is provided for entries on your task's page; _rosetta.txt_. Feel free to use it.
* If you do not use the template remember to use:
    * ```=={{header|Vlang}}==```
    * ```<lang vlang></lang>```
* __Please run ```v fmt```__ on your files before posting to RosettaCode or to the GH
    * I understand that vfmt does not work with generics at the moment (2020-02-22), so please take care with formatting.  
      I plan run vfmt on the github and check RosettaCode "frequently"
* Filenames should be snake case and clear enough that the related task can be identified
* If possible:
    * try to include a main method where you print to console
    * or include some kind of graphic to demonstrate the result
* Put files in a subdirectory as equivalent to the task listing on RC
    * i.e. On RC, Averages/Pythagorean Means => progs/Averages/pyth_means.v
* Make a to-do list issue, so people know what you're working on :)
